## Description / Intro
- A racing game that goes by the name of BlueRaii which is currently in development. This game will be powered by Unity3D engine and written in C#.

- This project is due to enter the Games Fleadh competition, the theme for this year is a Racing Game which is why we have decided to make an original Racing Game.

- An endless racing game where you need to dodge stuff like pillars and move left or right using a phone as the control.

##Idea / Gameplay
- An Andriod device that would be able to control the car instead of using the keyboard.

- 1 game mode that switches all the time. (1 freeroam mode when you can move to the left or right as much as you want and the other where you’re limited to move.

- Cops chasing the player.

- Pillars and missiles that if the players collides into them, it will slow down the player and the cops may catch up.

- Main screen with a moving background so when start is pressed you zoom into the car and start playing the game.

- The car would have a max speed so you can’t go to infinity speed. So for example some car could go up to 150 mph.
