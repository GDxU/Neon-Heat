#### Idea/Goal
- Unlike other racing games the team have decided to come up with something special, our goal is to use motion instead of keyboard buttons to control the car.

- What if you could pull out your phone and just connect it to the game and use it to control the car, making it feel like you're actually driving the car in real life.
