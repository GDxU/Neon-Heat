#### Introduction
A racing game that goes by the name of Neon Heat which is currently in development. This game will be powered by Unity3D engine and written in C#.

This project is due to enter the Games Fleadh competition, the theme for this year is a Racing Game which is why we have decided to make an original Racing Game.

#### Idea/Goal
- Unlike other racing games the team have decided to come up with something special, our goal is to use motion instead of keyboard buttons to control the car. However we took into account that not everyone would want to use their phone so we have also enabled the keyboard to control
the car.

- Although for the best user exprience the player would want to control the car with their phone.

- Original sound tracks to be included along with some cool animations.

- A thrilling gameplay that doesn't limit the user to continuously do one thing only, we will include a free roam mode where things
get interesting.
